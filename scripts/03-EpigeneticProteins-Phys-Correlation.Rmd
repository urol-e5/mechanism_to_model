Correlation between the epigenetic protein counts from the gene count matrix and the PC1 (calculated in 01-Physiology.Rmd). 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

Read in PC data 
```{r}
phys_pc <- read.csv("../data/01-Physiology/phys_data_pc.csv")
```

Read in gene count matrix 
```{r}
count_matrix <- read.csv("../data/RNAseq/Poc_gene_count_matrix.csv")
```

Read in blast results for Pverr against epigenetic proteins of interest 
```{r}
blast <- read.delim("../output/02-Pver-blast/Mach-blastp-Pver_out.tab", sep = "", header = F)
```
